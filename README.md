## About the Work

We study a Kerr-modified cavity magnomechanical system with a focus on its bistable regime.
We identify a distinct parametric condition under which bistability appears, featuring two stable branches and one unstable branch in the middle.
Interestingly, our study reveals a unique transition where the upper branch loses its stability under a sufficiently strong drive, giving rise to limit cycle oscillation.
Consequently, we report a rich phase diagram consisting of both bistable and periodic solutions and study the quantum correlations around them.
While in the bistable regime, we find the entanglement reaching a different steady state, and in the unstable regime, entanglement oscillates in time.
This study is especially important in understanding quantum entanglement at different stable and unstable points arising in a Kerr-modified cavity magnomechanical system.

*Note:* Data files have been excluded from this repository to fit GitHub's storage limits without using Git LFS services.
These files can be generated by running their corresponding scripts.

## Installing Dependencies

All numerical values are calculated using [QuantRL](https://github.com/sampreet/quantrl), an open-source backend-agnostic Python framework to interface deterministic and stochastic quantum models for reinforcement learning.
Refer to the [README](https://github.com/sampreet/quantrl?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for the steps to install this library.

The Wigner distributions are obtained using the [Quantum Optomechanics Toolbox](https://github.com/sampreet/qom), an open-source Python framework to simulate optomechanical systems.
Refer to the [QOM toolbox documentation](https://sampreet.github.io/qom-docs/v1.0.1) for the steps to install this libary.

## Running the Scripts

To run the scripts, navigate *inside* the top-level directory, and execute:

```bash
python scripts/bar/baz.py
```

Here, `bar` is the name of the folder (containing the version information) inside `scripts` and `baz.py` is the name of the script (refer to the repository structure).

*Note:* To generate Figure 4, run `4_script.py`, `4_wigner.py` and `4.py` sequentially.
